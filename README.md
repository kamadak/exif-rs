Exif parsing library written in pure Rust
-----------------------------------------

   This is a pure-Rust library to parse Exif data.
   This library parses Exif attributes in a raw Exif data block.
   It can also read Exif data directly from some image formats.

   Supported formats are:
   -  TIFF and some RAW image formats based on it
   -  JPEG
   -  HEIF and coding-specific variations including HEIC and AVIF
   -  PNG
   -  WebP

Usage
-----

   Add a dependency entry to your Cargo.toml.  Specify "kamadak-exif"
   if you use crates.io.  The canonical name of this crate is "exif",
   but it is renamed on crates.io to avoid a naming conflict.

      [dependencies]
      kamadak-exif = "0.5"

   Add the following to your crate root (before Rust 2018).

      extern crate exif;

   Run "cargo doc" in the source directory to generate the API reference.
   It is also available online at <https://docs.rs/kamadak-exif>.

   See examples directory for sample codes.

   Rust 1.40 or later is required to build.
